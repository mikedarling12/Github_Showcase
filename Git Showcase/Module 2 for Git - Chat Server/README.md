# Overview

This software is a server that hosts a chat room, which allows users with the chat app to join to chat with friends or others online.

This program was designed to act as a stepping stone to learning more complex server projects.

# Network Communication

For this prohect, I am using a server/client relationship.

This client useds a TCP connection using port 8080.

Right now, it only sends strings back and forth, so nothing crazy.

# Development Environment

I am using sockets to allow users to connect to the server on my end.

I programmed the function in python and used the time, socket, and sys libraries.
