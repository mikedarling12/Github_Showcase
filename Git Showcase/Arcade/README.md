# Overview

I am trying to learn as many languages as I can to further my software engineering capabilities.
In this program, I followed Python to make sure I didn't lose touch with those skills.

I followed the tutorial listed under useful websites to learn the functions.

By tackling this program, I hoped to learn more about React and its various functions.
